**🔑 🔑  [Solana Beginner Crash Course](./workshops/beginner-crash-course) atölyesi yeni tamamlandı.  Let this serve as a template for all future workshops, including associated documentation and recordings. Bunun, ilgili belgeler ve kayıtlar da dahil olmak üzere gelecekteki tüm atölyeler için bir şablon görevi görmesine izin verin. **
